  <h1><u>Kannur</u></h1>
   <p>Located on the Malabar Coast of Kerala, Kannur (fondly known as Cannanore), is a beautiful city bundled with a plethora of sightseeing options like beaches, monuments, ancient temples and picnic spots.

    Steeped in the distinctive local art forms like Theyyam, Kannur still has an aura of the bygone colonial era. The deep footprints of the Dutch, the Portuguese, the British and the Mysore Sultanate are still imbibed into the town and can be witnessed all around. The town is blessed with exceptional art of weaving that has earned it the title of the land of loons and huge cashew trees perhaps rooted by Portuguese. Take an evening stroll near the lighthouse beach or explore Portuguese history at St. Angelo's Fort while you are in Kannur.</p>

        <br>
      <p>The untouched shores of the Dharmadam Island offer an escape from routine, worries, and tiredness like
        never before. Because of its segregation from the hustle and bustle of city life, the island has become a
        retreat centre for weary travellers.

        Surrounded by rivers on three sides and the Arabian sea on one side, the island features a brilliant view
        of the confluence of Anjarakandy and Thalassery Rivers. The canopy of tall coconut trees, the picturesque
        views of the sea, dense bushes peppered along the beach – all of this makes the island a sight to behold.
        Take a stroll along the sandy beach and dip your toes into the pristine waters. Experience solitude like
        never before.
