    <h1><u>Kollam</u></h1>
    <p>A treasure trove of natural wonders and historical edifices, Kollam is an enchanting town with backwaters and picturesque landscapes. Located 70kms away from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, Kollam is a commercial centre and home to India’s cashew producing industry. Popularly known as Quilon, it is often regarded as the gateway to the backwaters of Kerala.

        It sits on the bank of the Ashtamudi Lake, hence, cruising along the Alappuzha route is one of the main highlights of the region. With a history dating back to the 9th century, Kollam was a prominent spice trading centre. It is one of the oldest ports in the Arabian Sea that lies on the southwest coast which was frequented by iconic merchants, missionaries and explorers including Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, Vasco da Gama, Henrique Henriques and many more. Venture the lesser-known path, and this beautiful city on India’s Malabar Coast is sure to enchant you.</p>

            <p>The Punalur Suspension Bridge is the first motorable bridge in South India. The suspension bridge
              crossing the river is the only suspended-deck type in south India. Built in 1877 by Albert Henry across
              the Kallada River, this huge bridge was suspended by two spans and was used for vehicular mov ement.
              Construction took more than six years. It is said that after completion of the bridge people hesitated to
              walk over the bridge. In order to prove the strength of the bridge the engineer and his family passed
              under the bridge in a country boat while six elephants were walking over it. Now the bridge is of
              historical interest and is a major tourist attraction.
