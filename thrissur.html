    <h1><u>Thrissur</u></h1>
    <p>Originally known as Thirusivapperoor and previously by its anglicized form Trichur, Thrissur is the cultural capital of Kerala due to its rich history, cultural heritage and archaeological wealth. The Kerala  Kalamandalam, the Kerala Sahitya Academy and the Kerala Sangeetha Nadaka Academy are located here. Built around a 65-acre hillock called the Thekkinkadu maidan, Thrissur is also the capital of the eponymous Thrissur district.</p>
  
    <h5><b> <u> Places to Visit in Thrissur</u></b></h5>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li> <b>Vadakkunnathan Temple.</b></li>
      <br>
      
      <br>
      <p>An ancient temple of Kerala, the Vadakkunnathan Temple is also the oldest temple of the state dedicated
        to Lord Shiva. Following the architectural style of Kerala, the temple has monumental towers surrounding
        it.

        Talking about the inside of the temple, there are several mural paintings that depict various episodes
        from the Hindu Epic, Mahabharata.

        Thekkinkadu Maidan, which surrounds the temple from all sides is where the local festival of Thrissur
        Pooram is organized every year, granting this place an even more of spiritual importance.
      </p>

      <br>
      <li> <b>Shakthan Thampuran Palace.</b></li>
      <br>
      
      <br>
      <p>Built after a rather Dutch style architecture, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace is a sight to behold.
        Finding its name in almost every list of Thrissur tourist places, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace was
        rebuilt in the place of Vadakkekara Palace in the year 1795 by the then King Ramavarma Thampuram of
        Cochin.

        In the year 2005, the palace was converted into a museum that now showcases a number of relics and really
        old antiques. A favourite one amongst several art admirers, the two-storeyed complex has high roofs,
        thicker than usual walls, and Italian Marble on the floor, making it a place right out of a travellerâ€™s
        dream.</p>

      <br>
      <li> <b>Athirappilly Waterfalls.</b></li>
      <br>
      
      <br>
      <p>On the outskirts of the city at a distance of some 60 km, the Athirappilly waterfalls mark one of the
        best places to visit in Thrissur. Standing 80 ft tall and about 330 ft wide, these falls are the largest
        in the state of Kerala.

        The majesty of this place can be understood by the fact that the falls are located on the Chalakudy River,
        that originates from the highest mountain in India outside of the Himalayas. A perfect place for a group
        outing, these falls are sometimes called the Niagra of India

      </p>

      <br>
      <li> <b> Dolours Basilica.</b></li>
      <br>
     
      <br>
      <p>The Dolours Basilica, or the Basilica of Our Lady of Dolours (as the full name goes), is a distinct
        building in the city of Thrissur. You can easily recognize this grand church from its white facade.

        Smack in the middle of a lush green valley, this basilica is known for narrating quite a number of stories
        of love and faith. Spread in an area of about 25,000 sq feet, Dolours Basilica is the third tallest church
        in Asia and the largest church in the country with double storeyed aisles.

      </p>

      <br>
      <li> <b>Kerala Kalamandalam.</b></li>
      <br>
     
      <br>
      <p>A University of Art and Culture, Kerala Kalamandir is a Government of India recognized institution
        dedicated to providing learning in the many performing arts native to India. Their main focus has always
        been on the arts that have been developed in Southern India.

        The Kerala Kalamandalam was what gave three main arts of Kerala a new life, namely Kathakali, Kudiyattam,
        and Mohiniyattam. For the sake of performing arts, and if you are someone who is a fanatic for them, this
        is definitely the place to be. The best part is that the institute is housed on the banks of the
        Bharathapuzha River.
