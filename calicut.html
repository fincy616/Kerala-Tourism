    <h1><u>Calicut</u></h1>
      <p>Situated in southern India between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, Kozhikode has been attracting travelers from antiquity. The city is also known by its Anglicized name, Calicut.
  
          Lured by the spice trade, Phoenicians, Arabs and Chinese headed for its shores. When Vasco da Gama landed on its shores in 1498, he paved the way for the Dutch, the French and later the English. As the major trading point of eastern spices, Calicut was known as the ‘City of Spices’.</p>

            <li> <b>Kozhikode Beach.</b></li>
            <br>
            
            <br>
            <p>Situated on the Malabar coast and endowed with natural beauty, Kozhikode beach should be a must in the
              itinerary of your visit to the city. This beach is renowned for the sunsets that tourists throng here to
              enjoy. Though the water is muddy and not suitable for swimming, still the stunning view of the Arabian Sea
              that the lighthouse offers more than compensates for the shortcoming.

              Payannakal, Putiyappa, Elathur, Beypore, all these beaches are part of the long stretch of Kozhikode
              beach. This beach lies on the western side of the city and is easily accessible through the four roads in
              the city.

            <li> <b>Mananchira.</b></li>
            <br>
            
            <br>
            <p>Previously known as Mananchira Maidan, this place held many football matches. Mananchira scores high as
              one of the places to visit in Kozhikode. This place provides tranquility to the visitors which is much
              sought after as one wants to escape the chaotic city life. It is a beautiful park covered with lawns,
              traditional buildings, a musical fountain, and an open-air theatre. This park is built around a man-made
              lake known as Mananchira lake.

              One must not forget to visit Mananchira or Mana Vikraman Tank which was the primary water source for the
              royal family and is maintained till date in its pristine beauty. Mananchira is the best place for an
              evening stroll or to enjoy a picnic with families and friends. This park is popular among tourists and
              locals because of its natural sculptures and natural beauty.

            <br>
            <li> <b>Beypore Beach.</b></li>
            <br>
            
            <br>
            <p>Situated near the mouth of Chaliyar river, Beypore beach is a famous tourist destination. Your visit to
              Kozhikode remains incomplete without a day spent at Beypore beach. There is never a dearth of activities
              once you are at the beach. Clearly, one of the favourite tourist places to visit in Kozhikode, this beach
              takes into a different world with its numerous fun-filled activities to keep you engaged as it offers
              abundant water activities like surfing, sunbathing, water skiing and swimming.

              You can take in the vast expanse of rich golden sand, coconut trees that dot the coastline or the stone
              bridge known as Pulimoodu, which builds a pathway into the sea. There is never a dull moment at the beach
              and you can pamper yourself in a refreshing Ayurveda massage.

            <li> <b>Thusharagiri Fall.</b></li>
            <br>
            
            <br>
            <p>Enjoy the breathtaking beauty of Thusharagiri Fall when you pay a visit to Kozhikode. Two streams
              originating from the Western Ghats meet at this point to create the Chalipuzzha River. The river further
              trifurcates to create three waterfalls and the free-falling water creates a mist, thus giving the name
              “Thusharagiri”.

              This place has a lovely view all around and you get plenty of activities to indulge in. You may go for
              trekking, or enjoy rock-climbing. You can also take a break to visit the wildlife sanctuaries or sit on
              the banks of the river to enjoy the waterfalls. The lush green forest and cool water of the streams all
              around add to your enjoyment. A word of caution though, people with a faint heart should avoid the place
              because it is nature at its wildest best. This is a place to awaken the nature lover and wildlife
              enthusiast in you.

            <li> <b> Kakkayam Dam.</b></li>
            <br>
            
            <br>
            <p>Kakkayam Dam is a famous picnic spot around Kozhikode because of its scenic beauty and plenty of choices
              for outdoor activities. Though the dam is small in size, it more than compensates with the small
              waterfalls around it. Take a peek at the varieties of animals and birds that inhabit the place. Or take a
              boat ride along the dam and see the small waterfalls and dense forests that surround the dam. Move around
              and soak in the scenic beauty of the hills around the dam.

              There is a hanging bridge on the waterfall which is another tourist attraction. Spare a day from your tour
              itinerary and visit this beautiful spot with your loved ones. Pamper the adventurer in you by going on a
              trek around the dam. This will always be a memorable visit.
