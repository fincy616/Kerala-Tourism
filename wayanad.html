    <p>Nestled in the Western Ghats, Wayanad is the least populous district in Kerala and is known for its mist-laden mountains, lush forests and green paddy fields stretching up to the horizon. With an altitude ranging from 700 to 2100 m, the climate of Wayanad is pleasant throughout the year.

        With a large part of the district covered by forests, Wayanad is home to some endangered species of animals and nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts can visit the numerous sanctuaries here. The Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, the second largest in Kerala was established in 1973. Typical of the Western Ghats, the landscape of the sanctuary is mountainous and temperatures range between 17-21 degrees centigrade.</p>
