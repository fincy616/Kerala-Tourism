    <h1><u>Trivandrum</u></h1>
    <p>The capital city of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram or Trivandrum, is an appealing blend of a strongly rooted heritage and a nostalgic colonial legacy. Built upon seven hills, this city has long since left the days when it was only used by seafaring explorers behind - today, Trivandrum is an expensive metropolis with quaint urban charm and plenty of architectural and historical places to visit. In addition, Trivandrum is a gateway to nearby popular beach towns of Kovalam and Varkala.

      The Padmanabhaswamy temple (also known as Anantha Padmanabhaswamy temple) is a must-visit temple of India. Other famous temples in Trivandrum include the Attukal Bhagawati temple, the Aazhimala Siva Temple, the Karikkakom Chamundi Devi Temple, and the Pazhavangadi Ganapathy Temple.
      
      The city is home to a few museums, such as the Kuthiramalika Palace Museum and the Napier Museum. The Kuthiramalika Palace Museum is situated close-by to the Padmanabhaswamy temple. Renowned for its Travancore styled architectural features and its structural elegance, this museum houses priceless paintings, traditional furniture, and other royal family collections.</p>
      <h5><b> <u> Places to Visit in Trivandrum</u></b></h5>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li> <b> Padmanabha Swamy Temple.</b></li>
            <br>
            <p> Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, the temple is a blend of the Kerala and Dravidian styles of architecture
              located inside the East Fort. One among rare Vishnu temples in, the presiding deity here is of Lord Vishnu
              reclining on Anantha the Serpent. The temple is a place for art lovers and is also known for its mural
              paintings and stone carvings.</p>

            <br>
            <li> <b> Agasthyakoodam.</b></li>
            <br>
            <p> Agasthyakoodam is the second highest peak in Kerala and is also a part of Sahyadri range of mountains,
              at a height of 1890 metres above sea level. Teeming with wildlife, the forests of Agasthyakoodam abound in
              rare medicinal herbs and plants and brilliantly hued orchids. A bird watchers paradise, this legendary
              mountain is accessible by foot from Kotoor, near Neyyar Dam, as also from Bonacaud. The season from
              December to April is advocated for trekking.

              This peak lies in Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala, India and is a part of the Agasthyamala Biosphere
              Reserve, which lies at the border of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. UNESCO has added Agasthyamala Biosphere
              Reserve to its World Network of Biosphere Reserves in March 2016. </p>

            <br>
            <li> <b> Padmanabhapuram Palace.</b></li>
            <br>
            <p>The splendid palace is situated at Thuckalai, on the way to Kanyakumari which once the seat of the
              erstwhile rulers of Travancore. This is a well preserved wooden palace, a glorious testimony to the
              traditional Kerala School of architecture. The extraordinary murals, exquisite floral carvings and the
              black glossy granite floor have withstood the test of time.

              This palace is one of the largest wooden palaces in India and its mostly made out of Rose and Teak Wood.
              Owned and maintained by the Government of Kerala, this palace is at a distance of 50 kilometers from
              Thiruvananthapuram city and 20 kilometers from Nagercoil. The palace is located at the foothills of the
              Veli Hills of the Western Ghats.

            <br>
            <li> <b> Varkala.</b></li>
            <br>

            <p>Varkala is a land of seaside resort and spa. It is also an important Hindu centre of pilgrimage. The
              final resting place of the great social reformer, Sree Narayana Guru, is near Varkala, atop a hill called
              Sivagiri. High cliffs with mineral springs rise majestically from the coastline. According to a myth, sage
              Narada was approached by a group of mendicants who confessed to having sinned. Narada threw his
              valkkalam(cloth made of the bark of a tree) into the air, and the place where it landed was subsequently
              named Varkala. The mendicants were directed by Narada to offer their prayers in the newly created place by
              the seashore. The place where they prayed for redemption, came to be known as the Papanasham Beach (
              Papanasham means redemption from sins). The 2000 year old Sree Janardhana Swamy Temple and the Nature Care
              Centre are the two main attractions here.
            </p>
            <li> <b> Kuthiramalika (Puthenmalika) Palace Museum.</b></li>
            <br>
            <p>The rare specimen of workmanship in the traditional Travancore style of architecture also known for
              exquisite wood carvings was built by Maharaja Swathi Thirunal Balarama Varma - the King of Travancore, who
              was a great poet, musician, social reformer and statesman. The palace museum displays paintings and
              various priceless collections of the royal family and is located near the Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple.
