          <br>
          
          <br>
          <p>The Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary or the Kadalundi Nagaram, is definitely one of the best places to visit in
            Malappuram. It sits right at the spot where River Kadalundi Puzha flows into the Arabian Sea.Easily
            accessible from Malappuram and Kozhikode, the bird sanctuary is host to about 100 species of native birds,
            and about 60 species of migratory birds.

            This includes Whimbrels, brahminy kites, terns, seagulls, sand plovers, sandpipers, green shanks and turn
            stones, all of whom appear to their respective seasons.
