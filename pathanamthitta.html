    <h1><u>Trivandrum</u></h1>
    <p>Pathanamthitta, in southern Kerala, is a town immersed in spirituality and mysticism. Blessed with several ancient temples, it is renowned as headquarters of pilgrimage in Kerala as Sabarimala is situated in the Pathanamthitta district. It is a land of untouched beauty with pristine rivers, lofty mountain ranges and sprawling coconut groves.

        The region is parted into a fascinating topography of highlands, midlands and lowlands crafted by three rivers coursing in the town. The town of Pathanamthitta is also marked by a culture unique to this place as well as an art of metal mirrors i.e. Aranmula Kannadi, handcrafted with intricacy and poise. The town also practices the art of 'vaasthu vidya' in its purest form at a heritage village of Vassthu Vidya Gurukulam. Bounded by captivating vistas at every step, this bewitching town promise of an experience you never dreamt of.</p>
        <h5><b> <u> Places to Visit in Pathanamthitta</u></b></h5>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li> <b> Pandalam Palace.</b></li>
            <br>
            <p>The Pandalam family was an off-shoot of the mighty Pandya dynasty, and in spite of being a small faction,
              commanded great wealth and respect in what is now modern Kerala, albeit thousands of years ago. The
              Pandalam Palace is maintained in their memory and contains mixed influences of Pandya and Malabar
              architecture. The Palace is considered the childhood home of Lord Ayyappa, and is one of the foremost
              Pathanamthitta tourist places.</p>

            <br>
            <li> <b>Thriveni Sangamam.</b></li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>Hindus believe that rivers originating from holy places have a cleansing effect, and a dip in one will
              erase all the sins in the past. Now, that depends on how much of a believer you are, but at Thriveni
              Sangamam, there’s one thing for sure - it’s one of the most breathtaking places to visit in
              Pathanamthitta. It is a confluence of three rivers - the Pamba River Manimala River and the Achankovil
              River, all deeply connected with Sabarimala.
            </p>

            <br>
            <li> <b> Gavi. </b></li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>Gavi is a carefully-protected natural reserve inhabited by some of the rarest and most elusive animals
              known to man. That’s why you have to be quiet, and carry your own litter when in Gavi. The local
              authorities, along with the villagers, go to great lengths to maintain this ecological vault of sorts.
              Gavi is a great place to go to trekking, but you have to be accompanied by forest officials wherever you
              go. The way the people treat Mother Nature will create deep respect for Gavi, making it one of the top
              tourist spots in Pathanamthitta.
            </p>

            <br>
            <li> <b>Konni Forest Reserve.</b></li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>The Konni Forest reserves are a great place to spend a day with your family if you’re visiting
              Pathanamthitta, especially because it’s a very well-organised forest resort with excellent guides willing
              to take you around the place.. If you can visit the elephant training centre where they break in wild
              elephants. Or, ride the bowl-shaped boats.
            </p>
            <li> <b> Aranmula.</b></li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>Aranmula, a UN heritage site, is famous for two things - the boat race and the Aranmula Parthasarathy
              Temple. Then, you can also buy an Aranmula Kannadi, an intricately-designed metal mirror made using a
              secret method that’s been passed down from over generations. It’s said to have a healing influence. Next,
              try and plan your trip during the Vallasadya, which is a huge 70-item feast celebrating the bravery and
              physical might of the oarsmen who participate in the boat festival.</p>
