<body>
    <p>Officially called Alappuzha, Alleppey is the picture-perfect place known for its beautiful backwaters and the houseboats offering overnight stays. The coastline of Alleppey offers some of the best beaches in Kerala with water sports during the dry season. 

        Alleppey is located close to Kochi in the South Indian state of Kerala. Its palm-fringed inter-connect network of canal backwaters attracts a lot of tourists from all over the world. Coupled with other beautiful places in Kerala like Munnar and Thekkady, Alleppey is often considered for a honeymoon or for a great family vacation. 
        
        There are plenty of houseboats, homestays, and rejuvenating Ayurvedic resorts that make staying in Alleppey brilliant. The houseboats pass through the serene backwaters, where you can catch glimpses of green paddy fields, choir-making activities, and witness the life of locals in Kerala.
        
        Be sure to catch a traditional snake boat race in the months of August and September and try out some toddy (palm wine) at a local toddy shop for adding a touch of authenticity to your travel experience in Allepey.</p>
